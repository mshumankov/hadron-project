         <h2>Hadron Platform</h2>
         <p>The Hadron Platform provides a new form of distributed consensus; a way for people who don't know or trust each
            other to securely collaborate and transact online without the need for a trusted intermediary. The platform is
            lightning fast, fair, and secure and, unlike some blockchain-based platforms, doesn’t require compute-heavy proof-of-work.
            Hedera enables and empowers developers to build an entirely new class of decentralized applications that were
            never before possible.</p>

         <h2>Fast</h2>
         <p>Hadron is fast. Right at the speed of your internet fast. The platform is built on the virtual-voting consensus
            algorithm, invented by Dr. Leemon Baird. This algorithm provides near-perfect efficiency in bandwidth usage,
            handling hundreds of thousands of transactions per second and verifying over one million signatures per second.
            Time to finality is measured in seconds; not minutes, hours, or days. Consensus is 100% certain and, unique to
            Hedera, guaranteed to never change.</p>

         <h2>Secure</h2>
         <p>Hadron has the strongest level of security possible in this category, which is asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance
            (aBFT). The platform is the only distributed ledger technology that has formally proven this quality. Achieving
            this level of security at scale is a fundamental advance in the field of distributed systems. Hedera guarantees
            consensus, in real time, and is resistant to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, an area of vulnerability
            for some public ledger platforms</p>

         <h2>How it works</h2>
         <p>Using a gossip protocol, nodes efficiently and rapidly exchange data with other nodes in the community. This automatically
            builds a hashgraph data structure using the novel “gossip about gossip” protocol. This data structure is cryptographically
            secure and contains the history of communication in a community. Using this as an input, nodes run the same virtual-voting
            consensus algorithm as other nodes. The community reaches consensus on the order and timestamp without any further
            communication over the internet. Each event is digitally signed by its creator.</p>

         <h2>Hadron cryptocurrency</h2>
         <p>The Hadron brings speed and efficiency to cryptocurrency. By swapping expensive proof-of-work consensus methods
            for virtual-voting, throughput is high, fees are low, and micropayments become practical, while keeping the network
            secure. Decentralized application developers will use hbars to pay for services on the network, such as processing
            transactions, running smart contracts, and storing files.</p>
