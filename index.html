               <h2>Build on change.Build on Hadron</h2>
               <p>You can easily build globally decentralized applications on top of the Hadron Platform using the native Hadron cryptocurrency. You will have complete ownership and discretion over the licensing you choose for these applications. The platform will provide a fluid ecosystem and transparent codebase and is supported by a diverse community that is committed to free education.</p>

         <h2>Hadron Platform</h2>
         <p>The Hadron Platform provides a new form of distributed consensus; a way for people who don't know or trust each other to securely collaborate and transact online without the need for a trusted intermediary. The platform is lightning fast, fair, and secure and, unlike some blockchain-based platforms, doesnâ€™t require compute-heavy proof-of-work. Hedera enables and empowers developers to build an entirely new class of decentralized applications that were never before possible.</p>

               <h2>Decentralized Intelligence</h2>
               <p>Hadron is a different kind of decentralized world compute platform. It is a platform managed by a decentralized intelligence integrated into its systems that can make arbitrary changes. This acts to mitigate misuse, protect users, fix problems, optimize network configuration and seamlessly upgrade its protocols.
               The system depends upon human-controlled "neurons" operated by special client software. These follow each other and cascade to decisions. Neurons are created by depositing dfinities and earn rewards for performance of voting services. While the expertise within the crowd is leveraged, follow relationships exist at the edges of the network making the decision process unknowable, protecting participants.</p>
